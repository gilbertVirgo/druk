				‘Well, Alison, pleasure is a huge part of what we do. The more
				fun we have while we’re active, the more likely we are to keep
				doing the things we enjoy. I always reckon it’s important that
				exercise makes us feel the best we can imagine. We can alter how
				much we do to maximise our pleasure, too. That definitely works
				for me down at the athletics track.’
			</p>
			<p>
				‘Makes sense to me, too, Links, and you’ve definitely helped me
				to have plenty of fun with my bow and arrow! I needed something
				that makes me feel good. I’m off to the range a couple of times
				a week now, instead of once a fortnight. Anyway, guess what else

				Less immediately forthcoming, Velma’s response is considered,

				‘V. You were brilliant. The first time Lincoln took me to hot
				yoga, I thought they were going to have to send me home in my
				water bottle. Remember that, Links? I was a nightmare.’
			</p>
			<p>
				‘Er, yes, you were a bit warm, as I recall, Ali. Then again, so
				was I, and I guess getting warm is the general idea, along with
				being good to yourself.’ Lincoln’s voice lowers. He leans
				forward again, this time lending gravity and intensity to his
				words. ‘But, look, the most important thing is that you didn’t
				give up. You came back and gave it another try, and then
				another, and another. That’s what you have to do and that’s why
				we can think about how much you’ve achieved through GOGA
				already, how much we’ve all achieved. Now you’re helping to
				inspire Velma, encouraging her, celebrating her achievements,
				setting targets with her, building trust. That’s fantastic and
				exactly what GOGA should be about. We can all help each other,
				inspire each other, and learn from each other. When you’re
				trying to do things on your own, it’s so much more difficult.
				You can be battling against loneliness, isolation, a world that
				looks at you like you’re from another planet, and authorities
				that would rather you just disappeared.’

				Velma and Alison both nod in unison. ‘Absolutely, Lincoln. The
				various authorities certainly didn’t waste much time in trying
				to shove me into the first available care home. I’m just so glad
				I held out and insisted on an independent life in the outside
				world instead. Now that I’m getting more active, that feels so
				important.’ Velma’s voice is quiet, composed, and determined.

				‘Bang on, V. Well said, girl.’ Alison taps the table in
				appreciation of her friend’s words. ‘Whoops, sorry about that,
				people. I didn’t just spill our drinks, did I? Sos, if I did.
				I’m always doing that.’
			</p>
			<p>
				‘No, Ali, not a drop, honestly.’ Lincoln’s reassurance is less
				convincing than originally intended. ‘Now, where were we? Yes,
				independence, and being part of the world around us. Actually,
				that’s one of the reasons why I feel so strongly about GOGA and
				about Peer support, or Peer Mentorship, if you like. It
				genuinely does make a difference. Once you’re part of GOGA
				you’re into something that changes people’s lives for the
				better. You could even say that it helps to make the difference
				between existence, and having genuine quality of life, a life
				that means something.’ Lincoln pauses for a gulp of his drink,
				before continuing.
