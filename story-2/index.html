				&lsquo;So, here, at last! Cracking day for it. Sorry I&rsquo;m
				late. I got halfway here, then had to go back for my wallet. I
				swear, some days I&rsquo;d forget my chair if I wasn&rsquo;t in
				it. Still, good to get a bit of a puff on, and give the old arms
				a work-out. Forgetting things can be a pretty good way to Get
				Out and Get Active, I guess. Anyway, how are you guys buzzing

				Alison, the younger of the two friends, and the only one of the

				&ldquo;Well, yep, you could say all&rsquo;s well with the GOGA

					&lsquo;Yeah, but that was before I found out I&rsquo;d be

				&lsquo;Well, Alison, pleasure is a huge part of what we do. The
				more fun we have while we&rsquo;re active, the more likely we
				are to keep doing the things we enjoy. I always reckon
				it&rsquo;s important that exercise makes us feel the best we can
				imagine. We can alter how much we do to maximise our pleasure,
				too. That definitely works for me down at the athletics
				track.&rsquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				&lsquo;Makes sense to me, too, Links, and you&rsquo;ve
				definitely helped me to have plenty of fun with my bow and
				arrow! I needed something that makes me feel good. I&rsquo;m off
				to the range a couple of times a week now, instead of once a
				fortnight. Anyway, guess what else we&rsquo;ve been
				doing?&rsquo;
			</p>
			<p>&lsquo;Go on, surprise me.&rsquo;</p>
			<p>
				&lsquo;Well, while you were sunning yourself and enjoying all
				that sangria, you weren&rsquo;t the only one feeling the heat,
				was he V?&rsquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				Less immediately forthcoming, Velma&rsquo;s response is
				considered, each word carefully weighed, as she props herself up
				on her arms, and shifts her position in her more conventional
				and cumbersome wheelchair. &lsquo;Definitely not. It was hot
				yoga for us last week and it certainly lived up to the name,
				anyway. I have to say, it was so nice to escape for a while and
				forget the world, relaxing, in its way, and it seemed to help
				with the pain I get. I&rsquo;m not sure I was any good, but I
				wasn&rsquo;t bad enough to be evicted for bringing hot yoga and
				the human form into disrepute, was I Alison?&rsquo;

				&lsquo;V. You were brilliant. The first time Lincoln took me to
				hot yoga, I thought they were going to have to send me home in
				my water bottle. Remember that, Links? I was a nightmare.&rsquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				&lsquo;Er, yes, you were a bit warm, as I recall, Ali. Then
				again, so was I, and I guess getting warm is the general idea,
				along with being good to yourself.&rsquo; Lincoln&rsquo;s voice
				lowers. He leans forward again, this time lending gravity and
				intensity to his words. &lsquo;But, look, the most important
				thing is that you didn&rsquo;t give up. You came back and gave
				it another try, and then another, and another. That&rsquo;s what
				you have to do and that&rsquo;s why we can think about how much
				you&rsquo;ve achieved through GOGA already, how much we&rsquo;ve
				all achieved. Now you&rsquo;re helping to inspire Velma,
				encouraging her, celebrating her achievements, setting targets
				with her, building trust. That&rsquo;s fantastic and exactly
				what GOGA should be about. We can all help each other, inspire
				each other, and learn from each other. When you&rsquo;re trying
				to do things on your own, it&rsquo;s so much more difficult. You
				can be battling against loneliness, isolation, a world that
				looks at you like you&rsquo;re from another planet, and
				authorities that would rather you just disappeared.&rsquo;

				Velma and Alison both nod in unison. &lsquo;Absolutely, Lincoln.
				The various authorities certainly didn&rsquo;t waste much time
				in trying to shove me into the first available care home.
				I&rsquo;m just so glad I held out and insisted on an independent
				life in the outside world instead. Now that I&rsquo;m getting
				more active, that feels so important.&rsquo; Velma&rsquo;s voice
				is quiet, composed, and determined.

				&lsquo;Bang on, V. Well said, girl.&rsquo; Alison taps the table

				did I? Sos, if I did. I&rsquo;m always doing that.&rsquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				&lsquo;No, Ali, not a drop, honestly.&rsquo; Lincoln&rsquo;s
				reassurance is less convincing than originally intended.
				&lsquo;Now, where were we? Yes, independence, and being part of
				the world around us. Actually, that&rsquo;s one of the reasons
				why I feel so strongly about GOGA and about Peer support, or
				Peer Mentorship, if you like. It genuinely does make a
				difference. Once you&rsquo;re part of GOGA you&rsquo;re into
				something that changes people&rsquo;s lives for the better. You
				could even say that it helps to make the difference between
				existence, and having genuine quality of life, a life that means
				something.&rsquo; Lincoln pauses for a gulp of his drink, before
				continuing.

				&lsquo;There was a time, about two years after I left the spinal
				unit, when it all looked hopeless. Whether it was compassion
				fatigue, or just the way a lot of my old friends drifted off
				into their own lives, I don&rsquo;t know, but, for whatever
				reason, there didn&rsquo;t seem to be anybody around. Things hit
				me all at once. I was even doubting whether it was worth being
				alive. So, I know how dark and lonely it can get. Now, all of
				that feels like another life-time ago. I don&rsquo;t know about
				you guys, but I can&rsquo;t imagine not being part of GOGA now.

				&lsquo;Yep, that&rsquo;s the beauty of it.&rsquo; Alison&rsquo;s
				response is almost automatic. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve defo done

				bloomin&rsquo; horrible pizzas and slobbing about at home for me
				now, honest. I&rsquo;m a new woman. I&rsquo;m even cooking and

			</p>
			<p>
				&lsquo;The thing is, Alison, having the confidence to cook is

				applies to you, as well, Velma, especially now that we&rsquo;ve
				made a start, eh? I can&rsquo;t tell you how much it means that
				you guys made it to the hot yoga class. It takes some guts to do

					&lsquo;Well it&rsquo;s still only eighteen months since you

					It&rsquo;s never easy. Strewth, like I told you before, I
					was a mess after my accident, a total mess. It was only when
					I got a warning from the doctor, telling me that I was
					borderline diabetic, that I made up my mind to do something
					about it.&rsquo; Lincoln pauses, and gathers his thoughts.
					&lsquo;It didn&rsquo;t start with organised sport for me,
					though. I started in my big old clunky wheelchair and got
					into the habit of pushing myself everywhere, rather than
					driving or getting the bus. It was just a &ldquo;me&rdquo;
					thing at first, but then I got involved with Disability
					Advice Service Bradford, Disability Rights UK, GOGA, and

				<p>
					&lsquo;An upward spiral rather, than a downward one,

				</p>
				<p>
					&lsquo;Precisely, Alison. That&rsquo;s how the mentorship

					boost, making a difference to others and helping people to
					avoid making the same mistakes as me. The point is that we
