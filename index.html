				Samosas, bhajis, and a selection of main courses flavour the

				of the gathering. First to speak is Malik, Kamila's husband,

					is my brother, Shabaz and, of course, you already know
					Kamila and me.'
				</p>
				<p>
					'A perfect day to Get Out and Get Active, perhaps, my
					husband?' Kamila's voice is the perfect invitation for Malik
					to laugh, smile, continue.
				</p>
				<p>
					'Absolutely, my dear Kamila. The weather gods, it seems, are
					our friends. Perhaps summer is here at last. Now, Geoff and
					Samantha, you know that I have already told Shabaz some of
					what it is that you do, but it would be good, I think, for
					him to hear more from you. Oh, and do please help yourself
					to food. We mustn't let all of that hard work go to waste,
					now, must we? It was so hot in the kitchen today, I can tell
					you.'
				</p>
				<p>
					'Shouldn't that be “we can tell you”, Malik? There were two

				'Yes. Yes, please.' Shabaz signals his assent, smiling
				nervously.
			</p>
			<p>
				After a moment's hesitation, during which Geoff and Samantha
				both begin to speak, then give way to one other, apologise, then
				begin again, order asserts itself. Samantha begins, explaining
				in warm, clear, enthused tones, what it means to be able to
				mentor others, and how the peer mentoring scheme has meant so
				much to her, ever since she was introduced to Geoff. 'Wonderful,
				isn't it, that mentorship can become such an interesting chain
				reaction?'
			</p>
			<br />
		</div>

		<p id="geoff-nods-agrees" class="center">
			Geoff, nods, agrees. 'Like dominos, really. Disability Rights UK
			have done something so special in bringing us all together in a way
			that helps us all. I mean, a year ago myself and Samantha hadn't
			even met, let alone us and Malik. Now we're all part of something,
			helping each other on a fascinating shared journey, an adventure.
			Who would have thought those early small steps would have brought us
			all so far?'
		</p>

		<p id="too-right-samantha" class="center">
			'Too right.' Samantha finds herself confirming, her bright
			complexion suddenly more serious for an instant. 'I'd hit thirty,
			and my vision and mobility were getting worse. The MS seemed to be
			getting more severe, and doing it fast. Then I met Geoff and he got
			me to the Swimming Club, helped me to meet other people like me,
			going through the same thing. He also encouraged me to focus on
			getting pleasure and enjoyment from exercising, which was a whole
			new way of looking at things, or it was for me, at least. As a
			result, I lost weight, got fitter, made friends. Geoff guided me
			through my own hard times and low points, and was such a great
			listener. He gave me the kick I needed to understand how I could
			start helping other people, too. It was amazing. Before I knew it,
			there I was, little old me, becoming a mentor as well, just like
			this man, here. Just shows what can happen when you've got someone
			there at your side, someone who knows what they're on about.'
		</p>

		<p id="cheers-samantha-i" class="left-aside">
			'Cheers, Samantha. I should be blushing, shouldn't I? But, to be
			fair, I reckon you helped me, just as much as I helped you. I mean,
			there were plenty of mornings I might have stayed in bed, if it
			hadn't been for those emails and texts and phonecalls of yours,
			reminding me it was swimming day. It takes two to tango, after all.'

				'Well, you have both done wonders for Malik, that much I do
				know.' Kamila's smile reassures, underlining her words. “It's
				true. He was turning into a potato.' She laughs and pats her
				husband's abdomen, prompting him to laugh as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				'Yes. I was putting on so much weight, losing confidence,
				feeling such a burden. I think part of the problem was not
				knowing what's out there for somebody like me, like us, I should
				say. That is one of biggest challenges, or it was for me. It can
				be so frustrating when you know that you could be doing more to,
				to…'
			</p>
			<p>'Get Out and Get Active, perhaps, Malik'</p>
			<p>
				'Yes, Geoff. Exactly. Get Out and Get Active, as they say at
				Disability Rights UK. That is the perfect phrase actually,
				because when you, when any of us, don't know where or how to
				even start to get physically active, let alone to carry on from
				there, life can become a downward spiral. You become not lonely,
				maybe, but isolated, if I can say that. I also used to worry
				about the amount of time it might take to do these things, but
				active time is time so well spent. And what else was I doing
				anyway, right? Just sitting around!'

		<h3 id="what-were-talking" class="center">
			“What we're talking about here is wellbeing, and everything that

		</h3>

		<p id="we-know-that" class="center">
			We know that feeling, Malik, don't we, Samantha?' Geoff turns
			towards Samantha, then faces Malik and Kamila again. 'What we're
			talking about here is wellbeing, and everything that involves. Not
			that it's easy. As you know, we had to start small, didn't we? It
			was all about setting realistic, achievable goals, helping each
			other to reach those targets, getting the ball rolling. So often,
			that is the hardest part. But, with peer support, we're all part of
			a team, and we motivate each other, right? The whole adventure, the
			process of re-energisation, has to be a shared experience, if we
			really want it to work.'
		</p>

		<div id="not-so-much" class="spread right-aside">
			<p>
				'Not so much support, really, as friendship, something
				meaningful.' Samantha's words carry the weight of certainty.
				'And that's just how it should be. There's so much out there,
				once you know where to find it, so many fab ways to get away
				from it all and clear your head.'
			</p>
			<p>
				'For sure, Samantha. Thanks to you and Geoff, I have seen such a
				big positive change in Malik. He is not just fitter. He is
				happier. He smiles. He is nice to himself now, as well as to me.
				We go out together again. Malik has remembered how to laugh. He
				is Malik again. Also we are learning together, learning all the
				time, adapting to life. That is such a beautiful thing for me to
				be able to say. Truly, it is.'
			</p>
			<p>
				'And you're even thinking of becoming a mentor, too. Right,
				Malik?'
			</p>
			<p>
				'Very true, Geoff. I think this can be another way forward for
				us. I can help others to see how good it can be to get active. I
				can be a proper Activity Warrior like you and Samantha.'
			</p>
			<p>
				'No reason why not, Malik. Even a little rocket like Samantha
				had to start somewhere. Now she's more “at it” than me.'
			</p>
			<p>
				'You've created a monster, Geoff.' Samantha's eyes sparkle with
				mischief. 'But, like you say, it ain't us that needs fixing,
				buddy. It's society. If I had my way there'd be no such thing as
				inaccessible.'
			</p>
			<p>
				'Now that would be good.' Shabaz nods several times. 'What I
				need to know now, though, is what activities I can do, and where
				I can do them?'

				'Certainly is!' adds Samantha, grinning. 'There's also plenty of

			</p>
			<p>'DASL?'</p>
			<p>
				'Disability Advice Service Lambeth, Shab.' Kamila's voice clears
				her brother-in-law's doubt.
			</p>
			<p>
				'And Lambeth Disability Sport and Leisure, of course. It's a
				partnership, Shabaz, just like all of us, mate.'
			</p>
			<p>
				'Thank you, Geoff. Yes. That makes sense. I will definitely do
				some of my own research too. I am sure there are so many
				wonderful ways to get active, and not all super-expensive
				either.' Shabaz's tone is lighter now, inspired
			</p>
		</div>

		<div id="youre-right-brother" class="center">
			<p>
				'You're right, brother, there are so many things you can try. I
				love to swim now and go climbing. There is a climbing wall at
				the sports centre. Did you know that, brother? Maybe you could
				come with us next time. There is nothing to be scared of. With
				Samantha and Geoff, everything is at the pace you need. You are
				in control. Everything is how you want it to be. Yes, there are
				difficult weeks, and there is no quick way to success, but when
				you have support from friends and family, and mentors, the bad
				times are balanced by the good times. You could even say that
				the bad times make the good times feel even better. It's about
				having fun, too. The more fun things are, the more you can
				achieve. I used to climb and swim like a tortoise. Now I am
				Sherpa Tensing and that American man, the swimmer with all the
				medals. Honestly, little brother.'
			</p>
			<p>
				'Michael Phelps, Malik?' Kamila raises an eyebrow, responding to
				her husband's unlikely claim.
			</p>
			<p>
				'Yes, Mr Michael Phelps, Kamila, my darling. I am Malik Phelps,
				or Malik Mike Kenny, or Malik Sarah Storey.'
			</p>
			<p>
				Kamila's laugh is open and spontaneous, a golden moment in its
				own right. 'You could maybe have chosen somebody a little more
				realistic, Malik.'

		<p id="yes-perhaps-you" class="center">
			'Yes, perhaps you are right, my darling.' Malik accepts a warm
			samosa from Kamila, before he continues. 'Still, though, Shabaz. You
			can see what we all mean. Peer mentoring can open so many doors.
			That is the important thing to understand. We can all be part of a
			team. A good team, like Crystal Palace, though, of course, not like
			that lot you support.'

		<div id="so-shabaz-what" class="spread center">
			<p>
				'So, Shabaz, what do you think?' Kamila leaves her question
				open.
			</p>
			<p>
				'Okay. Yes. Let's go for it. No climbing, though. I don't even
				like to think about heights. Swimming is a maybe.'
			</p>
			<p>
				'Well, there are things like yoga, zumba, and dance classes,
				too. We often go dancing at the community centre. Sometimes
				Malik even manages not to squash my poor toes, don't you Malik?'
			</p>
			<p>
				'Absolutely, Kamila, my darling, and sometimes Mrs Scary does
				not tell us off for laughing too much during her classes!'
			</p>
			<p>
				'Of course, there are plenty of less formal things you can do,
				Shabaz. Just getting out for a regular walk, with a friend, that
				can make a massive difference. Weight training, too, or, in
				fact, anything where you work your muscles until they're 'tired
				out, can be great options as well. Brilliant for strength, and
				overall health. But maybe we could start with athletics. Kamila
				and Malik tell me you were a regular little Mo Farah at school.
				A school record-holder right?'
			</p>
			<p>
				'Malik and Kamila are exaggerating a little, I think, Geoff,
				but, yes, I was fast, before my eyes began to go bad. Athletics?
				Yes. Yes. Okay. That we can try, but where?'
			</p>
			<p>
				'Samantha can help you there, Shabaz. Her boyfriend is a coach
				at the athletics club. He can help with access to the track and
				equipment. Isn't that right, Samantha?'
			</p>
			<p>
				'Yep. Sure can, Geoff'. Samantha accepts her fellow mentor's
				invitation, between bites of bhaji. 'Sorry. Delicious, these!
				Yes. He'd be chuffed to help. Make him feel useful, for a
				change.'
			</p>
			<p>
				Laughter ripples across the group, gradually increasing in
				intensity, then subsiding, enough for the party to coordinate
				their diaries and their phones, set alerts for a week on Friday,
				and for Kamila to take charge.
			</p>
			<p>
				'Well, now that we are all set for a week on Friday, perhaps you
				would all like some more food, while at least some of it is
				still warm. Eat up, now, or we will all starve before we even
				get to the Athletics Club.'
