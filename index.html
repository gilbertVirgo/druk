				<p>
					&#8216;So, Geoff, Samantha, it is such a pleasure to welcome
					you to our Team GOGA Buffet, and on such a beautiful day.
					This is my brother, Shabaz and, of course, you already know
					Kamila and me.&#8217;
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8216;A perfect day to Get Out and Get Active, perhaps, my
					husband?&#8217; Kamila&#8217;s voice is the perfect
					invitation for Malik to laugh, smile, continue.
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8216;Absolutely, my dear Kamila. The weather gods, it
					seems, are our friends. Perhaps summer is here at last. Now,
					Geoff and Samantha, you know that I have already told Shabaz
					some of what it is that you do, but it would be good, I
					think, for him to hear more from you. Oh, and do please help
					yourself to food. We mustn&#8217;t let all of that hard work
					go to waste, now, must we? It was so hot in the kitchen
					today, I can tell you.&#8217;
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8216;Shouldn&#8217;t that be &#8220;we can tell
					you&#8221;, Malik? There were two of us in the kitchen, when
					I last counted.&#8217;

					<p>
						&#8216;Quite so, quite so, Kamila, my dear wife. Anyway,
						how shall we proceed?&#8217;
					</p>
					<p>
						&#8216;Well, Malik, perhaps the best way forward is for
						Geoff, Samantha, and yourself to explain how peer
						mentoring has benefitted you, so that Shabaz can get a
						clearer idea of what it&#8217;s all about. What do you
						all think?&#8217; Kamila, seated now between Malik and
						Shabaz, pats her brother-in-law&#8217;s hand, as her
						question rides the pause.

				<p>
					&#8216;Yes. Yes, please.&#8217; Shabaz signals his assent,
					smiling nervously.
				</p>
				<p>
					After a moment&#8217;s hesitation, during which Geoff and
					Samantha both begin to speak, then give way to one other,
					apologise, then begin again, order asserts itself. Samantha
					begins, explaining in warm, clear, enthused tones, what it
					means to be able to mentor others, and how the peer
					mentoring scheme has meant so much to her, ever since she
					was introduced to Geoff. &#8216;Wonderful, isn&#8217;t it,
					that mentorship can become such an interesting chain
					reaction?&#8217;
				</p>

				<h3>
					Geoff, nods, agrees. &#8216;Like dominos, really. Disability
					Rights UK have done something so special in bringing us all
					together in a way that helps us all. I mean, a year ago
					myself and Samantha hadn&#8217;t even met, let alone us and
					Malik. Now we&#8217;re all part of something, helping each
					other on a fascinating shared journey, an adventure. Who
					would have thought those early small steps would have
					brought us all so far?&#8217;
				</h3>

				<p>
					&#8216;Too right.&#8217; Samantha finds herself confirming,
					her bright complexion suddenly more serious for an instant.
					&#8216;I&#8217;d hit thirty, and my vision and mobility were
					getting worse. The MS seemed to be getting more severe, and
					doing it fast. Then I met Geoff and he got me to the
					Swimming Club, helped me to meet other people like me, going
					through the same thing. He also encouraged me to focus on
					getting pleasure and enjoyment from exercising, which was a
					whole new way of looking at things, or it was for me, at
					least. As a result, I lost weight, got fitter, made friends.
					Geoff guided me through my own hard times and low points,
					and was such a great listener. He gave me the kick I needed
					to understand how I could start helping other people, too.
					It was amazing. Before I knew it, there I was, little old
					me, becoming a mentor as well, just like this man, here.
					Just shows what can happen when you&#8217;ve got someone
					there at your side, someone who knows what they&#8217;re on
					about.&#8217;

					<p>
						&#8216;Cheers, Samantha. I should be blushing,
						shouldn&#8217;t I? But, to be fair, I reckon you helped
						me, just as much as I helped you. I mean, there were
						plenty of mornings I might have stayed in bed, if it
						hadn&#8217;t been for those emails and texts and
						phonecalls of yours, reminding me it was swimming day.
						It takes two to tango, after all.&#8217;

				<p>
					&#8216;Well, you have both done wonders for Malik, that much
					I do know.&#8217; Kamila&#8217;s smile reassures,
					underlining her words. &#8220;It&#8217;s true. He was
					turning into a potato.&#8217; She laughs and pats her
					husband&#8217;s abdomen, prompting him to laugh as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8216;Yes. I was putting on so much weight, losing
					confidence, feeling such a burden. I think part of the
					problem was not knowing what&#8217;s out there for somebody
					like me, like us, I should say. That is one of biggest
					challenges, or it was for me. It can be so frustrating when
					you know that you could be doing more to, toâ€¦&#8217;
				</p>
				<p>&#8216;Get Out and Get Active, perhaps, Malik&#8217;</p>
				<p>
					&#8216;Yes, Geoff. Exactly. Get Out and Get Active, as they
					say at Disability Rights UK. That is the perfect phrase
					actually, because when you, when any of us, don&#8217;t know
					where or how to even start to get physically active, let
					alone to carry on from there, life can become a downward
					spiral. You become not lonely, maybe, but isolated, if I can
					say that. I also used to worry about the amount of time it
					might take to do these things, but active time is time so
					well spent. And what else was I doing anyway, right? Just
					sitting around!&#8217;

					We know that feeling, Malik, don&#8217;t we,
					Samantha?&#8217; Geoff turns towards Samantha, then faces
					Malik and Kamila again. &#8216;What we&#8217;re talking
					about here is wellbeing, and everything that involves. Not
					that it&#8217;s easy. As you know, we had to start small,
					didn&#8217;t we? It was all about setting realistic,
					achievable goals, helping each other to reach those targets,
					getting the ball rolling. So often, that is the hardest
					part. But, with peer support, we&#8217;re all part of a
					team, and we motivate each other, right? The whole
					adventure, the process of re-energisation, has to be a
					shared experience, if we really want it to work.&#8217;

						&#8216;Not so much support, really, as friendship,
						something meaningful.&#8217; Samantha&#8217;s words
						carry the weight of certainty. &#8216;And that&#8217;s
						just how it should be. There&#8217;s so much out there,
						once you know where to find it, so many fab ways to get
						away from it all and clear your head.&#8217;
					</p>
					<p>
						&#8216;For sure, Samantha. Thanks to you and Geoff, I
						have seen such a big positive change in Malik. He is not
						just fitter. He is happier. He smiles. He is nice to
						himself now, as well as to me. We go out together again.
						Malik has remembered how to laugh. He is Malik again.
						Also we are learning together, learning all the time,
						adapting to life. That is such a beautiful thing for me
						to be able to say. Truly, it is.&#8217;
					</p>
					<p>
						&#8216;And you&#8217;re even thinking of becoming a
						mentor, too. Right, Malik?&#8217;
					</p>
					<p>
						&#8216;Very true, Geoff. I think this can be another way
						forward for us. I can help others to see how good it can
						be to get active. I can be a proper Activity Warrior
						like you and Samantha.&#8217;
					</p>
					<p>
						&#8216;No reason why not, Malik. Even a little rocket
						like Samantha had to start somewhere. Now she&#8217;s
						more &#8220;at it&#8221; than me.&#8217;
					</p>
					<p>
						&#8216;You&#8217;ve created a monster, Geoff.&#8217;
						Samantha&#8217;s eyes sparkle with mischief. &#8216;But,
						like you say, it ain&#8217;t us that needs fixing,
						buddy. It&#8217;s society. If I had my way there&#8217;d
						be no such thing as inaccessible.&#8217;
					</p>
					<p>
						&#8216;Now that would be good.&#8217; Shabaz nods
						several times. &#8216;What I need to know now, though,
						is what activities I can do, and where I can do
						them?&#8217;

					&#8216;Which is where Samantha, Geoff, and Malik, come in,

				<p>
					&#8216;You&#8217;re right, brother, there are so many things
					you can try. I love to swim now and go climbing. There is a
					climbing wall at the sports centre. Did you know that,
					brother? Maybe you could come with us next time. There is
					nothing to be scared of. With Samantha and Geoff, everything
					is at the pace you need. You are in control. Everything is
					how you want it to be. Yes, there are difficult weeks, and
					there is no quick way to success, but when you have support
					from friends and family, and mentors, the bad times are
					balanced by the good times. You could even say that the bad
					times make the good times feel even better. It&#8217;s about
					having fun, too. The more fun things are, the more you can
					achieve. I used to climb and swim like a tortoise. Now I am
					Sherpa Tensing and that American man, the swimmer with all
					the medals. Honestly, little brother.&#8217;

					Malik Phelps, or Malik Mike Kenny, or Malik Sarah
					Storey.&#8217;

					Kamila&#8217;s laugh is open and spontaneous, a golden

					&#8216;Yes, perhaps you are right, my darling.&#8217; Malik

					&#8216;Still, though, Shabaz. You can see what we all mean.
					Peer mentoring can open so many doors. That is the important

			<section>
				<p>
					&#8216;So, Shabaz, what do you think?&#8217; Kamila leaves
					her question open.
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8216;Okay. Yes. Let&#8217;s go for it. No climbing,
					though. I don&#8217;t even like to think about heights.
					Swimming is a maybe.&#8217;
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8216;Well, there are things like yoga, zumba, and dance
					classes, too. We often go dancing at the community centre.
					Sometimes Malik even manages not to squash my poor toes,
					don&#8217;t you Malik?&#8217;
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8216;Absolutely, Kamila, my darling, and sometimes Mrs
					Scary does not tell us off for laughing too much during her
					classes!&#8217;
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8216;Of course, there are plenty of less formal things you
					can do, Shabaz. Just getting out for a regular walk, with a
					friend, that can make a massive difference. Weight training,
					too, or, in fact, anything where you work your muscles until
					they&#8217;re &#8216;tired out, can be great options as
					well. Brilliant for strength, and overall health. But maybe
					we could start with athletics. Kamila and Malik tell me you
					were a regular little Mo Farah at school. A school
					record-holder right?&#8217;
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8216;Malik and Kamila are exaggerating a little, I think,
					Geoff, but, yes, I was fast, before my eyes began to go bad.
					Athletics? Yes. Yes. Okay. That we can try, but
					where?&#8217;
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8216;Samantha can help you there, Shabaz. Her boyfriend is
					a coach at the athletics club. He can help with access to
					the track and equipment. Isn&#8217;t that right,
					Samantha?&#8217;
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8216;Yep. Sure can, Geoff&#8217;. Samantha accepts her
					fellow mentor&#8217;s invitation, between bites of bhaji.
					&#8216;Sorry. Delicious, these! Yes. He&#8217;d be chuffed
					to help. Make him feel useful, for a change.&#8217;
				</p>
				<p>
					Laughter ripples across the group, gradually increasing in
					intensity, then subsiding, enough for the party to
					coordinate their diaries and their phones, set alerts for a
					week on Friday, and for Kamila to take charge.
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8216;Well, now that we are all set for a week on Friday,
					perhaps you would all like some more food, while at least
					some of it is still warm. Eat up, now, or we will all starve
					before we even get to the Athletics Club.&#8217;
